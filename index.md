33 years old software developer and devops passionate about open-source whether it's software or hardware.
As a perfectionist, I am in favour of fast, clean, tested, aesthetic and secure code.
Curious by nature, I have the need to continuously learn new and different things.
I am a data enthusiast, I enjoy understanding how things work, both hardware and software, this lead me to several projects gravitating around it.
